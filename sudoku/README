Python Sudoku Game with Separate Solver.

Requires:
 pygame (python module)
 inputbox.py (bundled)
 sudoku.py (bundled)
 sudoku_g.py (runnable)

Recommended:
  Python >= 2.6
  Python <  3.0

To Run:
  python ./sudoku_g.py 

Play Menu:
  Select Tiles with the Mouse,
  Left Click to Select a Tile
  Input values using 1-9 to fill in the tiles, backspace to clear
  Note the game prevents you from doing invalid actions
  Right Click to see Help Menu

Design Issues:
  There are 3 copies of the game at any one time,
   - One in the Solver, One in the Game Instance, One as the Buttons
   - Can be solved by merging the solver and the game
  Not all generated games are valid sudoku games
   - Randomly generated board are generally solvable (see [1])
   - Valid games are suppose to have UNIQUE solution
     - replicate by repeatedly resetting and auto-solving the same game
  UI Isn't pretty enough
   - I learned pygame just to do this.

Comments about Sources:
 sudoku.py is a highly refactored and fixed version of Norvig[1]'s solver.
 I chose to leave a solver separate from the UI stuff for easier testing.
 The solver is rather simple in design, it brute forces using a depth first
 search algorithm.  It simple recurses into sub-games while randomly selcting
 values to get the first one to solve for the puzzle.
 I intentionally added a 'random' into the solver to see the non-uniqueness of
 the solutions in a randomly generated sudoku game.
 
 inputbox.py was fixed and updated from a source found through pygame so it had
 numerous bugs and had to add more features to fit the need for this game.

 sudoku_g.py was written completely by me, but it probably could use some more
 clean up to make it prettier, and possible even split out the Board class.
 It's possible to just implement the solver here as well, but I chose to keep
 the solver separate for testing purposes.

 pygame's 2D graphics do seem insufficient, but I am not very good at doing UI
 designs, especially in the colors department.
