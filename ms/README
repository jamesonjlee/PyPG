HOW DOES IT WORK:
  Takes the name fiels and creates a Matrix where ROWS and COLUMNS are TUTORS
  and PLAYERS.  Each entry is the FLF score of the matching.  The optimal match
  is calculated using the Hungarian (Kuhn-Munkres) Algorithm via munkres.  The
  matrix is flipped before it actually is used (so min-flow => max-flow).
